Chrome Extension for audio/video downloads

The `sithub` folder is the server. Feel free to run it on your own server, but make sure you change the `GURL` variable in `popup.js`
I can't upload this extension to chrome webstore because I don't have a chrome webstore dev account ($5 fee).


# How to Install

1. chrome://extensions
2. Load unpacked
3. Select the root folder of this repo
